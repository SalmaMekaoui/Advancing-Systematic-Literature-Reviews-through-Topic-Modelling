# Advancing-Systematic-Literature-Reviews-through-Topic-Modelling
In this work, we propose an application to simplify the systematic review process for researchers by performing topic modeling. Instead of manual article analysis, our application employs topic modeling to extract key themes.
To visualize the results of topic modeling and assist in your systematic review, please ensure you add the path to the folder where the articles are located. This is required for the code to access and process the articles correctly.
